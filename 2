EXP NO: 2(i) COMPARISON OF TWO STRINGS USING SHELL PROGRAM
AIM:
To write a shell program to compare the two strings.
ALGORITHM:
1. Enter into the vi editor and go to the insert mode for entering the code
2. Read the first string.
3. Read the second string
4. Compare the two strings using the if loop
5. If the condition satisfies then print that two strings are equal else print two
strings are not equal.
6. Enter into the escape mode for the execution of the result and verify the output
PROGRAM:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the first String : "
read str1
echo "Enter the second String : "
read str2
if [ $str1 = $str2 ]
then
echo "Strings are Equal"
else
echo "Strings are Unequal"
fi


EXP NO: 2(ii) MAXIMUM OF THREE NUMBERS USING SHELL PROGRAM
AIM:
To write a shell program to find greatest of three numbers.
ALGORITHM:
1. Declare the three variables.
2. Check if A is greater than B and C.
3. If so, print A is greater.
4. Else check if B is greater than C.
5. If so, print B is greater.
6. Else print C is greater.
PROGRAM:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter A : "
read a
echo "Enter B : "
read b
echo "Enter C : "
read c
if [ $a -gt $b -a $a -gt $c ]
then
echo "A is greater"
elif [ $b -gt $a -a $b -gt $c ]
then
echo "B is greater"
else
echo "C is greater"
fi
EXP NO: 2(iii) MULTIPLICATION TABLE USING SHELL PROGRAM
AIM:
To write the shell program to check whether the number is odd or even.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Get the input, use a for loop to read numbers in the range from 1 to 10
Step 3: Calculate the result
Step 4: Increment the variable and repeat
Step 5: Display the result.
Step 6: Terminate the program.
PROGRAM:
#!/bin/bash
echo "which number to generate multiplication table"
read number
i=1
while [ $i -le 10 ]
do
echo "$number * $i =`expr $number \* $i ` "
i=`expr $i + 1`
done





EXP NO: 2(iv) BASIC ARITHMETIC OPERATION USING SHELL PROGAMMING
AIM:
To write the shell program to perform the basic arithmetic operations.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Read the inputs
Step 3: Perform the arithmetic calculation.
Step 4: Print the result.
Step 5: Stop the execution.
PROGRAM:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter value A :"
read a
echo "enter value B : "
read b
c=`expr $a + $b`
echo "sum:"$c
c=`expr $a - $b`
echo "sub:"$c
c=`expr $a \* $b`
echo "mul:"$c
c=`expr $a / $b`
echo "div:"$c
